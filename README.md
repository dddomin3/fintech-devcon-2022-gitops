# FinTech DevCon GitOps Workshop Repo
This repository is the follow-along repository for @willjschmitt's talk at the
2022 FinTech DevCon on using GitOps as a methodology to version all aspects of
configuration changes for applications in addition to infrastructure.

The companion slide deck can be found at https://bit.ly/gitops-devcon-2022.

This repository uses a combination of scripts to configure it appropriately and
patchfiles, which can be applied to follow along.

Ensure you run `setup.sh` to replace usernames in this repository with your own
